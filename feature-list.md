# Feature list

This is more of a free-write, but this is a dummy application just to practice 
on my programming skills.

In this app, I'll be creating an expense/budget application. I'll focus on these things at 
first: 

- creating a new expense report.
- add a total amount for budget.
- calculate difference between report and budget.

Focus on the backend..coding concepts...then render the front end :)  

I'm just going to focus on the single expense part at first, but this will have seperate projects later on.
You know what, screw it! I'll create a project table with a budget field within it. It will be easier and better
in the long run! ;) 

Store info in cents and then parse the number in a currecy formart. `number_format()` will be useful for this.


## Challenge Ideas

- Differentiate different currnencies (for international peeps of course).
- Provide a notice when a project goes over budget or perhaps lock every user into 
  creating another budget field when the project goes over budget.
- Considering above, maybe add integrate braintree, paypal, stripe or other services within this app.
